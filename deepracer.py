    @on_track (boolean) :: The vehicle is off-track if the front of the vehicle is outside of the white

    max 'x' value in the coordinate system.

    @y (float range: [0, 1]) :: Fraction of where the car is along the y-axis. 1 indicates
    max 'y' value in the coordinate system.

    @distance_from_center (float [0, track_width/2]) :: Displacement from the center line of the track
    as defined by way points

    @car_orientation (float: [-3.14, 3.14]) :: yaw of the car with respect to the car's x-axis in
    radians

    (x,y,yaw) that define a turning point

    @closest_waypoint (int) :: index of the closest waypoint (0-indexed) given the car's x,y
    position as measured by the eucliedean distance
